## Example: Roman Numeral Conversion

**Scenario**: We want to expand our business to one of the largest european market, the Roman Empire.  

As a first step, we must be able to convert arabic numbers to roman numerals and vice versa. 

The maximum number being supported is 3999.

Also prefer the subtractive form for numbers beginning with a '4' or '9'.
